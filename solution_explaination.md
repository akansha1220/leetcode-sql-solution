Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of how it works:

Inner Query 1 (t1):

The query first selects all records from the insurance table where the tiv_2015 value appears more than once. This is achieved using a subquery with GROUP BY and HAVING COUNT(tiv_2015) > 1.
This part of the query identifies policies that had the same total insured value in 2015, which might indicate duplicate or similar records.
Inner Query 2 (t2):

Another subquery groups the insurance records by their latitude (lat) and longitude (lon) and selects those with exactly one occurrence (HAVING COUNT(*) = 1).
This subquery is used to filter out locations where there is only one policy, possibly indicating unique geographical locations with no overlap.
Main Query:

The main query performs a CROSS JOIN between the results of t1 and t2, but only retains those records where the pid (policy ID) matches in both subqueries (t1.pid = t2.pid).
This effectively filters the records to include only those policies that had a duplicate TIV in 2015 but are associated with unique geographical locations in the dataset.
Aggregation:

Finally, the query calculates the sum of tiv_2016 for these filtered records and rounds the result to two decimal places using the ROUND() function.
Result:

The query returns the total insured value for 2016 (tiv_2016) for policies that had a duplicate value in 2015 and are located in unique geographical areas based on their latitude and longitude.
