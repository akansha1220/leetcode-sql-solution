This SQL query is designed to calculate the total insured value (TIV) for the year 2016, specifically focusing on a subset of records in the `insurance` table. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of how it works:

1. **Inner Query 1 (t1)**: 
   - The query first selects all records from the `insurance` table where the `tiv_2015` value appears more than once. This is achieved using a subquery with `GROUP BY` and `HAVING COUNT(tiv_2015) > 1`. 
   - This part of the query identifies policies that had the same total insured value in 2015, which might indicate duplicate or similar records.

2. **Inner Query 2 (t2)**:
   - Another subquery groups the `insurance` records by their latitude (`lat`) and longitude (`lon`) and selects those with exactly one occurrence (`HAVING COUNT(*) = 1`).
   - This subquery is used to filter out locations where there is only one policy, possibly indicating unique geographical locations with no overlap.

3. **Main Query**:
   - The main query performs a `CROSS JOIN` between the results of `t1` and `t2`, but only retains those records where the `pid` (policy ID) matches in both subqueries (`t1.pid = t2.pid`).
   - This effectively filters the records to include only those policies that had a duplicate TIV in 2015 but are associated with unique geographical locations in the dataset.

4. **Aggregation**:
   - Finally, the query calculates the sum of `tiv_2016` for these filtered records and rounds the result to two decimal places using the `ROUND()` function.

**Result**:
- The query returns the total insured value for 2016 (`tiv_2016`) for policies that had a duplicate value in 2015 and are located in unique geographical areas based on their latitude and longitude.

This query is useful for analyzing how certain insurance policies have changed over time in specific, non-overlapping locations while considering only those policies with potential duplicate values in the previous year.
